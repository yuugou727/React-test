# React-test
Develope with node.js and other dependencies

  In this branch I've tried to using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)to install and manage pakages.
  
  1.You need install node.js & yarn
  
  2.cmd promt redirect to project directory
  
  3.type cmd
  
    yarn install
    
  this will install all dependencies according to package.json
    
    
    
  PS. cmd for development & production
  
    yarn run dev
    
    yarn run prod
